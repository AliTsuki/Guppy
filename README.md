# Python-Markov-Chain-Generator-Plus
Guppy, the Weighted Markov Chain Generator written in Python

The concept is to create an intelligent Markov Chain Generator that uses not only randomization, but weights the next word in a sentence based on its likelihood to follow the previous word based on a database of sentences, and also weights which words belong in a sentence based on how likely a group of words is to appear in a sentence based on the same database. Or something like that.
