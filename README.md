Python Markov Chain Generator Plus

The concept is to create an intelligent Markov Chain Generator that uses not only randomization, but weights the next word in a sentence based on it's likelihood to follow the previous word based on a database of sentences, and also weights which words belong in a sentence based on how likely a group of words is to appear in a sentence based on the same database.

Work in progress...
